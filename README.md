## üöÄ Quick Start

### **One-Command Installation**

Install and run the entire Jira Dashboard with a single command:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NotEclipsed/jira-dashboard/master/scripts/auto-setup.sh | bash
```

The script will ask for your:
- **Jira Base URL** (e.g., `https://company.atlassian.net`)
- **Jira Email** (your login email)
- **Jira API Token** (see setup below)

That's it! Everything else is automated.

### **After Installation**

- **Access:** `http://your-server-ip:3000`
- **Login:** `admin` / `ChangeMe123!`
- **Management:** `pm2 list`, `pm2 logs`, `pm2 restart all`

## Jira API Setup

### Step 1: Generate an API Token

1. Go to [Atlassian Account Security](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Click "Create API token"
3. Give it a meaningful label (e.g., "Jira Dashboard")
4. Copy the generated token (you won't be able to see it again!)

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

In your `.env` file:

- **REACT_APP_JIRA_BASE_URL**: Your Jira instance URL (e.g., `https://company.atlassian.net`)
- **REACT_APP_JIRA_EMAIL**: Your Jira account email address
- **REACT_APP_JIRA_API_TOKEN**: The API token you just created

### Step 3: Test the Connection

Start the application and check the browser console for any authentication errors. The dashboard should load your tickets automatically.

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start development server
- `npm build` - Build for production
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm eject` - Eject from Create React App (not recommended)

## Architecture

Secure **client-server architecture** with authentication:
- **Frontend (React)**: Modern dashboard with Material-UI
- **Backend (Node.js)**: Secure API server with session management
- **Authentication**: User login with automatic session timeout
- **Security**: HIPAA-compliant audit logging and data protection

## API Integration

The application uses Jira REST API v3 with the following endpoints:

- `GET /rest/api/3/myself` - Get current user information
- `GET /rest/api/3/search` - Search for tickets using JQL
- `POST /rest/api/3/issue/{key}/comment` - Add comments to tickets
- `GET /rest/api/3/issue/{key}/transitions` - Get available transitions
- `POST /rest/api/3/issue/{key}/transitions` - Update ticket status

All API calls are authenticated using Basic Auth with email and API token.

## Security Notes

- **API Token**: Keep your API token secure and never commit it to version control
- **Environment Variables**: The `.env` file is automatically ignored by Git
- **CORS**: This is a client-side application, so your Jira instance must allow CORS requests
- **Permissions**: The application can only access tickets you have permission to view

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to get user info"**
- Check that your Jira base URL is correct (no trailing slash)
- Verify your email address matches your Jira account
- Ensure your API token is valid and not expired

**"No tickets found"**
- Verify you have tickets assigned to or created by you in Jira
- Check that your Jira permissions allow viewing tickets
- Look at the browser console for detailed error messages

**CORS Errors**
- This application makes requests from the browser to Jira
- Some Jira configurations may block cross-origin requests
- Consider setting up a proxy server for production use

**Slow Loading**
- The application fetches all tickets on load
- For users with many tickets, consider implementing pagination
- Network requests to Jira may be slow depending on your instance location

## Customization

The application is built with React and Material-UI, making it easy to customize:

- **Styling**: Modify colors and themes in `src/App.js` and CSS files
- **Components**: Add new features by creating components in `src/components/`
- **API**: Extend the Jira service in `src/services/jiraService.js`
- **Filters**: Add new filtering options in the Dashboard component
